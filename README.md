A premade, fancy looking menu structure with a preset variable list, and a premade and ready to go FX Controller for most cases where you just plop your own animation clips into.

Elaborating on that FX Controller: It uses a highly optimized setup all around.

— Toggle and slider setup in an easy to read blendtree. (Documentation on how to use the tree provided)

— Expandable high-performance clothing switches (tops, pants, shoes)

— Premade Outfit preset logic, you just edit the parameter drivers to your needs.

— Uses reliable WD On workflow

DISCLAIMER

BUDDYWORKS Avatar Framework comes as is, without warranty of operation or liability of me when things go wrong. Please acknowledge that when using this asset, you are still thinking. It also assumes you are willing to learn about new and improved ways of doing things, like incorporating Direct BlendTree toggle/sliders. (Documentation provided)

This is a creator's asset intended for new projects and major reworks, not really for retrofitting to existing avatars. It certainly is not a click and run kind of deal, it is a template you can use to get a quick start on everything avatar creation, every time.

Feel free to contact me on my Discord if you have any questions.
